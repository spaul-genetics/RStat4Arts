# Probability

## Coin Toss

::: incremental

* If you toss a coint, what is the probability that you get a head (H)?

* 1/2

* Why?

* There were two "mutually exclusive and exhaustive" outcomes and head is one of them 

:::

## Dice 

::: incremental

* If you roll a dice what is the probability of getting an even number?

* 3/6

* Why?

* There are 6 "mutually exclusive and exhaustive" outcomes and three of them are even.

:::

## Some Probability Rules

::: incremental

* $P(\emptyset) = 0$
* $P(\Omega) = 1$
* $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
* $P(B|A) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}$
* $P(A\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A) = P(A|B)P(B)$
* $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \Rightarrow \text{Independence}$

# Random Variable

## Definition

* In some sense a random variable is not a variable
* It is a function from a sample space to real number
* Can be discrete or continuous 

## Discrete RV

::: incremental

* Example: Binomial

* Definition: number of successes in a fixed number of trials

* Each survey participant is a trial; number of male is a binomial random variable

* Depends on two parameters: $n$ - number of trials, $p$ - probability of success

* Mean : $np$

* Variance : $np(1-p)$

## Continuous RV
